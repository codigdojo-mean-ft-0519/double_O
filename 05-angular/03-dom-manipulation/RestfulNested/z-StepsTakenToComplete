Copied previous project folder  with new name:  RestfulTasksNested >> restfultasksnested Did global replace from old names on all files:  DOMRestful domrestful

Opened two terminal windows and ran:
ng build --watch
nodemon server.js

changed port to 8003 to help prevent conflicts

opened http://localhost:8003/  confirming it still displays all tasks as before

Using Postman, confirmed it still works on the files
