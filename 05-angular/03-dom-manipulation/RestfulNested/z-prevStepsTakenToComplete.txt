Opened this folder in VS Code:  C:\1Files--create-RKH-062616\JasonF-MEAN-Stack-f\mean-assignment-landscape\05-angular\03-dom-manipulation

Opened bash and entered ng new RestfulTasksNested...files and folders created as expected.  added this steps file and an assignment.txt files

Closed VS Code then re-opened as DOMRESTFUL

Drug/copied .prettierrc from an older project

via Windows Explorer copied from fetch-data/restfullTasksthe server folder and server.js file to this new project

Ran ng build --watch from 1bash terminal...this created the dist folder...errros including can't find mongoose...shoud I run npm git, etc?  but maybe ng serve will do it

Modified app.component.ts and app.component.html to match the top of the output file, but the harder part is getting the database items to show

Ran ng g s http which is ng generate serve with service name http to get the files http.service.spec.ts and http.service.ts

Kind of working backwards...set up things in the app.component.html so the page will display properly if the attributes were proper including an array of task objects...then in app.component.ts created a dummy array ....it displayed fine

Per the DOM M/Observable tab imported OnInit at top of app.component.ts

Per Fetch Data/Service imported HttpService at top of module.ts file

Completed steps in FetchData/Service and received the success listed at the bottom:  tasks printed in console

Moving on to DOM/Observables tab

I completed all those steps circa 0200 051919 and the output should reflect the database, but it doesn't.  these lines seem to be the issue in the app.component.ts:
      console.log('Got our tasks!', data);  ...data is the array needed by tasks
      // this.tasks = data['/tasks'];  .....tried various things to get data assigned to tasks on right side of =
Because when giving tasks above  tasks = [...   a dummy array of objects, it outputs on the web page fine, but in the above could not get it to working

Working with Wes...
This was correct:  this.tasks = data;..I believe I had tried it, but either something else was going on, or the red squiggles under this.tasks caused me to move on.  Turns out those were just Linting errros

To solve the linting errors, made a task class by using ng generate class task--this added files task.ts (this file received some enhancements) and task.spec.ts--..added several more things in files such as app.component.html, app.component.ts, http.service.ts...look for comments in these files.  This was about creating a class so we could type this.tasks to stop red squiggles.

still had red squiggles, but then open and close app.component.ts solved

Still had errors in console related to displaying third item in list...which were happening because something was trying to display before existing...solution:  div *ngIf="tasks">
